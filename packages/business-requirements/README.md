# `business-requirements`

## Rough Idea

Non-developers can maintain business features spec within this package. Each requirement can then be consumed and (hopefully) confirmed by the repo which elects to honour them.

### How?

By writing requirements out in a **Given**, **When**, **Then** style

## Rough TODO list

- Work out a folder structure
- Enforce linting(?)
- Make importable to other repos/packages
- Add in some actionable business requirements

## N.B.
